# Mikrocata2Teams-Notification
This script (teams_alert.sh) is designed to monitor the mikrocataTZSP0.service alerts and send real-time notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel via webhooks. It works by continuously checking logs for newly blocked IP addresses and formatting them into a structured alert for easy review.
